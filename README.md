Max Chunks To Make Sorted — Java Implementation

This project contains a clean and simple Java solution to the “Max Chunks To Make Sorted” problem, commonly asked in coding exercises and university assignments.

The program reads a list of integers from standard input and prints the chunks such that, when each chunk is individually sorted and concatenated, the entire array becomes fully sorted.

 Features

Accepts integer input from STDIN

Automatically forms valid chunks

Prints each chunk on a new line

Works with any number of integers

No exception handling needed

Compatible with most university/online judge platforms

 Input Format

A single line of integers separated by spaces.

Example:
1 0 4 3 2 5 6 7

Output Format

Each chunk printed on a new line.

Example Output:
1 0
4 3 2
5
6
7
